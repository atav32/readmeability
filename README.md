# Readmeability

Testing how to make README instructions more obvious for speed-readers and busy people.

Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents program. Armies, students, and some
societies are programmed. An assault on large problems employs a succession of programs, most of
which spring into existence en route. 

##### 1. `Download and install` vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html as well as virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

hese programs are rife with issues that appear to be particular to
the problem at hand. 

##### 2. `git clone git@github.com:tangerinewhite32/readmeability.git`
##### 3. `git clone git@github.com:zconnelly13/keywordlove_vagrant.git`

TTo appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must
turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs -- many of them. 

##### 4. `vagrant up --provider virtualbox`

It doesn’t matter much what the programs are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is
how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater
programs. 

##### 5. `vagrant ssh`
##### 6. `sudo adduser <username>`

The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection. In this book
the use of ‘‘program’’ is focused on the creation, execution, and study of programs written in a dialect
of Lisp for execution on a digital computer. Using Lisp we restrict or limit not what we may program,
but only the notation for our program descriptions.

##### 7. `vagrant up --provider virtualbox`

Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us with three foci of phenomena: the human
mind, collections of computer programs, and the computer. Every computer program is a model,
hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and
thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood. 

They are modeled to our permanent satisfaction rarely by our computer programs. Thus even though our
programs are carefully handcrafted discrete collections of symbols, mosaics of interlocking functions,
they continually evolve: we change them as our perception of the model deepens, enlarges, generalizes
until the model ultimately attains a metastable place within still another model with which we struggle.

The source of the exhilaration associated with computer programming is the continual unfolding
within the mind and on the computer of mechanisms expressed as programs and the explosion of
perception they generate. If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of
programs!
